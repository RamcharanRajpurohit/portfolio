`fixed` – used for positioning an element relative to the viewport; use when you want an element (like navbar or button) to stay in the same place even when scrolling.
fixed = “Bro, I ain’t movin’ no matter what you scroll.”

sticky = “I’ll chill and scroll with you, but when I hit my top spot? I’mma lock in 💀.”

**`top-0` – used to position an element at the top of its container or viewport (based on `position` like `sticky`, `fixed`, etc); use when you want it to stick or fix to the top edge.**
**`start-0` – used to position an element at the start (left in LTR, right in RTL) of its container or viewport; use with `position` utilities like `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`.**

border-b – adds a 1px solid border to the bottom of an element; use when you want a clean bottom divider or underline effect.

border-gray-200 – sets the border color to Tailwind’s light gray (#e5e7eb); use when you want a soft, subtle border for clean UI vibes.

**`max-w-screen-xl` – sets the max width of an element to match the `xl` breakpoint (1280px); use when you want content to be responsive but not stretch too wide on big screens.**

🧱 Translation: “Stay chill bro, no full-screen bloat allowed past XL.”

flex-wrap – allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines instead of overflowing in one row; use when you have too many items and want them to flow like Tetris.

justify-between – distributes flex items horizontally with space between them; use with flex on the parent container.

mx-auto – sets horizontal margins to auto, centering the element horizontally inside its parent; works best with a fixed width or max-w.

space-x-3 – adds horizontal spacing (0.75rem or 12px) between direct child elements in a flex row; use with flex-row.

rtl:space-x-reverse – reverses the direction of horizontal spacing in RTL (right-to-left) layouts; use it with space-x-* when supporting languages like Arabic or Hebrew.

self-center – aligns a single flex item vertically to the center of the container; use it on a child inside a flexbox when you want that one item to be centered.

self-center – aligns a single flex item vertically to the center of the container; use it on a child inside a flexbox when you want that one item to be centered.

**`order-2` – sets the flex item’s order to 2, pushing it after items with lower order (default is 0); use inside a `flex` container to rearrange item positions.**

📦 Use like: `flex order-2`
🗣️ “I’m chillin’ behind the scenes… unless you promote me 😎.”

**`space-x-3` – adds horizontal spacing (0.75rem / 12px) between direct child elements in a horizontal flex row; use with `flex flex-row`.**

🧱 Use like: `flex space-x-3`
🗣️ “I keep my squad spaced out just right — no overlaps, no drama 💅.”

📦 Use like: `block w-full`
🗣️ “I don’t share space—I’m the main character. I take the whole line, deal with it 😤.”


whitespace-nowrap – prevents text from wrapping to the next line; use when you want content (like buttons or labels) to stay on a single line no matter what.
